# 03-Text-Adventure
Escape Room is a text adventure game that incorporates a game loop that accesses libraries in a json file to create the story. Players are asked to input a command, and the verb that they use corresponds to a specific action if the library recognizes the input. There is only one room in the game right now, but more rooms could make for a very challenging and interesting game.
