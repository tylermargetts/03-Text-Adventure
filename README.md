# 03-Text-Adventure
Escape Room is a text adventure game that uses a game loop to access libraries in a json file and create the story. Players are asked to input a command, and the verb that they use corresponds to a specific action if the library recognizes the input. Different locations within the game are designated as rooms in the json file, even if they are not their own room. Instead, the 'room' system is used to maneuver around the escape room and interact with different things.
